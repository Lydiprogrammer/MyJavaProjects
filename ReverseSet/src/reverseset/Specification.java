	 * Create an ordered String set that stores its elements in reverse ABC order.
	 * To do this, create a Comparator implementation,
	 * which method implements the opposite of the natural sorting of String (String.compareTo). 
	 * Ask from user 5 Strings to put in the set and write out the set after each input.
	 * If the user gives a String that is already in the set, then it is deleted from it.
